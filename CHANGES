0.27
 - Remove (the need for) INLINE.h
 - Change Rmpz_sprintf to return the number of characters written.
 - Change Rmpz_sizeinbase and Rmpz_size to return unsigned longs instead
   of signed long ints.
 - Add __GNU_MP_VERSION, __GNU_MP_VERSION_MINOR, __GNU_MP_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL,
   __GMP_CC and __GMP_CFLAGS
 - Change Rmpz_scan0 and Rmpz_scan1 to return unsigned long. (Returning a 
   signed long int was wrong.)
 - Change Rmpz_printf() so that, like its fprintf and sprintf counterparts,
   it formats only one variable at a time.
 - Fix bug in Rmpz_init_set_str (and Rmpz_init_set_str_nobless) that led to
   a segfault if string was invalid (ie if mpz_init_set_str() returned true).

0.26
 - Add Rmpz_fprintf, Rmpz_sprintf and Rmpz_sprintf_ret.
 - Add Rmpz_out_raw and Rmpz_inp_raw.

0.24
 - Add TRmpz_out_str and TRmpz_inp_str.
 - Rmpz_out_str now takes an optional (leading) string argument - a
   string that will be prepended to the mpz_out_str() output.
 - Remove the tests in the Makefile.PL that test for the presence of
   a suitable compiler and GMP library.
 - Remove the "homegrown" primes and supplementary functions from the 
   list of exportable functions. (They don't really belong here.) Also
   remove the documentation pertaining to these functions from the POD.
   This is done in preparation for the eventual removal of these 
   functions from Math::GMPz. For the time being, however, these
   functions are still available via their fully-qualified names - and
   they're still being tested in the test suite.

0.22 
 - Rewrite new()
 - Rmpz_out_str() now takes an optional third argument - a string that
   will be appended to the mpz_out_str() output. Also stdout is
   fflush()'d each time Rmpfr_out_str() is called.
 - The overload functions and new() can now handle a long double value
   correctly

0.21
 - Add "Name" section to the pod
 - Remove 'Makefile.old' from the source. (Doh !!)

0.20
 - First CPAN release
 - No longer assign Exporter and DynaLoader to @Math::GMPz::ISA.
 - Add support for use64bitint
 - add new() function/method to facilitate initialization/assignment
